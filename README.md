# Summer2018Project
I self-learned Python over the summer to assist Dr. Iyad Obeid, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Temple University (whom I job shadowed for a career development course), with one of his ongoing studies. This study involves working with in-game measurements of tennis players' movements, collected using motion sensors. The objective is to analyze which of several possible independent variables (or “features”, like hip rotation angle or elbow angle) significantly contribute to what zone on the other side of the court a tennis ball lands when hit by the player. This data could potentially map out better strategies for tennis players in terms of striking form. I helped to not only debug and analyze Python code written by Dr. Obeid's graduate students on the study but also create displacement vs. time and rotation degree vs. time graphs using Matplotlib comparing each “feature” to the time taken for the ball to hit the other side of the court.
